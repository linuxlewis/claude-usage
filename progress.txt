## Codebase Patterns
- Use Xcode project (not SPM) since MenuBarExtra requires app bundle with Info.plist
- Build command: `xcodebuild -scheme ClaudeUsage -destination 'platform=macOS' build`
- Test command: `xcodebuild test -scheme ClaudeUsage -destination 'platform=macOS'`
- Source files in ClaudeUsage/ directory, tests in ClaudeUsageTests/
- When adding new .swift files, they must be added to the pbxproj file with PBXFileReference, PBXBuildFile, and added to the Sources build phase
- Info.plist is at ClaudeUsage/Info.plist with LSUIElement=true for menu bar-only app
- UsageViewModel.startPollingIfConfigured() must be called after saving new credentials to restart the polling loop
- ErrorState must be Equatable to use == in SwiftUI view conditionals (e.g. `if viewModel.errorState == .authExpired`)
- API dates use ISO8601 with fractional seconds (e.g. "2026-02-08T18:59:59.661633+00:00") — use custom dateDecodingStrategy with ISO8601DateFormatter(.withFractionalSeconds) and fallback
- The usage API response has `resets_at` as a nullable Date string even within non-null limit objects (e.g. seven_day_sonnet can have utilization: 0.0 with resets_at: null)
- pbxproj IDs follow pattern: AA000010 for PBXBuildFile, AA100013 for PBXFileReference — increment from last used
- Avoid complex array concatenation expressions with optionals in Swift — the type checker will time out. Use compactMap or imperative append instead
- UsageViewModel is the shared ObservableObject passed from ClaudeUsageApp to ContentView and future views
- ContentView takes `@ObservedObject var viewModel: UsageViewModel` — all views that need usage data get it from viewModel
- KeychainService uses service name "com.claudeusage.credentials" with account keys "sessionKey" and "orgId"
- UsageService uses URLSession with dependency injection (pass custom session for testing)
- Use URLProtocol subclass mock for testing URLSession-based network code — register via URLSessionConfiguration.ephemeral with protocolClasses

## 2026-02-08 20:06 - US-001
- What was implemented: Xcode project scaffold with SwiftUI MenuBarExtra app, Info.plist with LSUIElement=true, and XCTest target
- Files changed:
  - ClaudeUsage.xcodeproj/project.pbxproj (new - Xcode project definition)
  - ClaudeUsage.xcodeproj/xcshareddata/xcschemes/ClaudeUsage.xcscheme (new - shared scheme)
  - ClaudeUsage/ClaudeUsageApp.swift (new - SwiftUI @main app with MenuBarExtra)
  - ClaudeUsage/Views/ContentView.swift (new - placeholder popover content)
  - ClaudeUsage/Info.plist (new - app metadata with LSUIElement=true)
  - ClaudeUsageTests/ClaudeUsageTests.swift (new - basic test target)
  - CLAUDE.md (updated - corrected build commands and directory paths)
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - MenuBarExtra requires an app bundle, so SPM executable won't work — must use Xcode project
  - pbxproj uses unique IDs (AA000001 format used here) — new files need entries in PBXFileReference, PBXBuildFile, and the relevant PBXSourcesBuildPhase
  - The scheme file must reference the correct BlueprintIdentifier matching the PBXNativeTarget ID
  - macOS deployment target is set to 13.0 in both project and target build settings
  - Swift 6.2.1 is on this machine, but project uses SWIFT_VERSION = 5.0 for compatibility

## 2026-02-08 20:09 - US-002
- What was implemented: UsageData and UsageLimit Codable models for decoding the claude.ai usage API response. All optional fields (seven_day_opus, seven_day_cowork, seven_day_oauth_apps, iguana_necktie, extra_usage) are Swift Optionals. Added 4 unit tests covering full response decoding, null optional fields, all fields present, and utilization value accuracy.
- Files changed:
  - ClaudeUsage/Models/UsageData.swift (new - UsageLimit and UsageData Codable models)
  - ClaudeUsageTests/ClaudeUsageTests.swift (updated - added 4 JSON decoding tests)
  - ClaudeUsage.xcodeproj/project.pbxproj (updated - added UsageData.swift to project)
  - prd.json (updated - US-002 passes: true)
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - API date format includes fractional seconds — need custom ISO8601 decoder with .withFractionalSeconds option
  - XCTAssertEqual with accuracy: parameter requires non-optional Double — use force unwrap (!) for optional values in test assertions where the value is known to exist
  - resets_at can be null even when the limit object itself is non-null (e.g. seven_day_sonnet with utilization 0.0)
  - New .swift files need 4 pbxproj entries: PBXFileReference, PBXBuildFile, group children, and Sources build phase files

## 2026-02-08 20:12 - US-003
- What was implemented: KeychainService struct with static methods for saving, reading, and deleting session key and org ID from macOS Keychain. Uses Security framework (SecItemAdd, SecItemCopyMatching, SecItemDelete) with service name "com.claudeusage.credentials".
- Files changed:
  - ClaudeUsage/Services/KeychainService.swift (new - Keychain CRUD operations)
  - ClaudeUsage.xcodeproj/project.pbxproj (updated - added KeychainService.swift to project)
  - prd.json (updated - US-003 passes: true)
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Keychain operations are hard to unit test in CI (require entitlements and user keychain access), so build-only verification is sufficient
  - Always delete before adding in Keychain to handle updates — SecItemAdd fails with errSecDuplicateItem if key already exists
  - @discardableResult on delete() is useful since callers often don't care about the delete result (e.g., when called as cleanup before save)
  - Security framework is available by default on macOS — no additional framework linking needed in pbxproj

## 2026-02-08 20:15 - US-004
- What was implemented: UsageService struct that fetches usage data from the claude.ai API. Uses URLSession with sessionKey cookie and anthropic-client-platform header. Returns decoded UsageData plus optional new session key from Set-Cookie. Handles 401/403 as specific AuthError type. Added 5 unit tests using URLProtocol mock: request construction, JSON decoding, Set-Cookie parsing, 401 auth error, 403 auth error.
- Files changed:
  - ClaudeUsage/Services/UsageService.swift (new - API client with fetchUsage(), error types, Set-Cookie parsing)
  - ClaudeUsageTests/ClaudeUsageTests.swift (updated - added UsageServiceTests class with 5 tests)
  - ClaudeUsage.xcodeproj/project.pbxproj (updated - added UsageService.swift to project)
  - prd.json (updated - US-004 passes: true)
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - URLProtocol mock pattern: create a subclass with static requestHandler and capturedRequest, register via URLSessionConfiguration.ephemeral with protocolClasses
  - UsageService takes sessionKey, orgId, and URLSession as init params — URLSession defaults to .shared for production, test passes custom mock session
  - Set-Cookie header is accessed via allHeaderFields["Set-Cookie"] on HTTPURLResponse — note the key is case-sensitive when accessing via dictionary
  - fetchUsage() returns a tuple (UsageData, newSessionKey: String?) so callers can update Keychain when a new key is received

## 2026-02-08 20:17 - US-005
- What was implemented: CircleProgress SwiftUI view component that draws a circular progress ring. Takes percentage (0-100) and optional size parameter. Ring fills proportionally via Circle().trim(). Color-coded: green (<50%), yellow (50-79%), red (>=80%). Background ring in gray at 0.2 opacity. Line width scales with size (15% of diameter) for consistent appearance at 16x16 and 32x32.
- Files changed:
  - ClaudeUsage/Views/CircleProgress.swift (new - reusable circular progress ring component)
  - ClaudeUsage.xcodeproj/project.pbxproj (updated - added CircleProgress.swift to project)
  - prd.json (updated - US-005 passes: true)
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Circle().trim(from:to:) draws clockwise from the "3 o'clock" position — use .rotationEffect(.degrees(-90)) to start from top
  - StrokeStyle with lineCap: .round gives polished rounded ends on the progress arc
  - Making lineWidth proportional to size (size * 0.15) ensures the ring looks good at both 16x16 menu bar size and 32x32 popover size
  - Clamping percentage with min(max(percentage, 0), 100) prevents visual bugs from out-of-range values
---

## 2026-02-08 20:20 - US-006
- What was implemented: Menu bar icon showing CircleProgress ring with highest utilization percentage and reset time in local timezone. Created UsageViewModel (ObservableObject) that computes highest utilization across all limits and formats reset time. Updated ClaudeUsageApp to use custom MenuBarExtra label with HStack of CircleProgress + Text. Updated ContentView to accept viewModel.
- Files changed:
  - ClaudeUsage/Models/UsageViewModel.swift (new - ObservableObject with highestUtilization, highestResetDate, resetTimeString)
  - ClaudeUsage/ClaudeUsageApp.swift (updated - @StateObject viewModel, custom MenuBarExtra label with ring + time)
  - ClaudeUsage/Views/ContentView.swift (updated - accepts @ObservedObject viewModel)
  - ClaudeUsage.xcodeproj/project.pbxproj (updated - added UsageViewModel.swift to project)
  - prd.json (updated - US-006 passes: true)
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Swift type checker times out on complex array concatenation with Optional.map — use compactMap or imperative loops instead
  - MenuBarExtra label: closure supports SwiftUI views like HStack with CircleProgress and Text
  - DateFormatter with "h:mm a" for time-only, "EEE h:mm a" for day+time — check Calendar.isDate(_:inSameDayAs:) to decide format
  - UsageViewModel holds shared state (@Published usageData, lastUpdated, errorState) for use across menu bar label and popover
---

## 2026-02-08 20:23 - US-007
- What was implemented: Usage popover with all limits displayed. Created UsageBar component showing name, circular ring, percentage, horizontal progress bar, and reset time. Updated ContentView to iterate over all non-nil limits using a new displayLimits computed property on UsageViewModel. Added "Updated X ago" footer with refresh and settings buttons. Added lastUpdatedString, displayLimits, refreshRequested, and settingsRequested to UsageViewModel.
- Files changed:
  - ClaudeUsage/Views/UsageBar.swift (new - single usage bar component with ring, bar, and reset time)
  - ClaudeUsage/Views/ContentView.swift (updated - full popover with ForEach over displayLimits, footer with refresh/settings)
  - ClaudeUsage/Models/UsageViewModel.swift (updated - added lastUpdatedString, displayLimits, refreshRequested, settingsRequested)
  - ClaudeUsage.xcodeproj/project.pbxproj (updated - added UsageBar.swift to project)
  - prd.json (updated - US-007 passes: true)
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Use GeometryReader for horizontal progress bars to get parent width for proportional fill
  - ForEach with enumerated() and id: \.offset works for iterating tuples that aren't Identifiable
  - UsageBar reuses the same color logic as CircleProgress for consistent color-coding across ring and bar
  - refreshRequested/settingsRequested as @Published Bool flags on viewModel allow child views to signal actions to parent

## 2026-02-08 20:26 - US-008
- What was implemented: Settings view accessible from the popover via gear icon. Contains a SecureField for session key, TextField for org ID, Save and Test Connection buttons, and auth status indicator (connected/expired/not configured). SettingsView uses KeychainService to load/save credentials and UsageService to test the connection. Added AuthStatus enum and updateAuthStatus() to UsageViewModel. Updated ContentView to toggle between usage view and settings view based on settingsRequested flag. Added "Open Settings" button to the "Not configured" state.
- Files changed:
  - ClaudeUsage/Views/SettingsView.swift (new - settings UI with auth fields, test connection, status)
  - ClaudeUsage/Views/ContentView.swift (updated - toggles between usage and settings views)
  - ClaudeUsage/Models/UsageViewModel.swift (updated - added AuthStatus enum, updateAuthStatus())
  - ClaudeUsage.xcodeproj/project.pbxproj (updated - added SettingsView.swift to project)
  - prd.json (updated - US-008 passes: true)
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Use @State for local form inputs in settings, load from Keychain in .onAppear
  - SettingsView takes @ObservedObject viewModel to share auth status with the rest of the app
  - SwiftUI SecureField works well for session key entry — same API as TextField
  - Test connection creates a temporary UsageService with the input values, not the saved ones
  - Back navigation is done by toggling viewModel.settingsRequested = false
---

## 2026-02-08 20:28 - US-009
- What was implemented: Automatic polling with 5-minute interval using async Task.sleep. UsageViewModel now has startPollingIfConfigured() that launches a polling loop, performFetch() that calls UsageService and updates state, and fetchNow() for manual refresh. Error states (auth expired, network error) are shown in both the menu bar icon and the popover. Auth errors (401/403) show a red exclamation circle and prompt to re-auth. Network errors show an orange warning triangle. Set-Cookie session key updates are saved to Keychain automatically. SettingsView calls startPollingIfConfigured() after saving credentials to restart the polling loop.
- Files changed:
  - ClaudeUsage/Models/UsageViewModel.swift (updated - added polling logic, performFetch, fetchNow, startPollingIfConfigured, made ErrorState Equatable)
  - ClaudeUsage/ClaudeUsageApp.swift (updated - menu bar label shows error state icons for auth expired and network error)
  - ClaudeUsage/Views/ContentView.swift (updated - popover shows auth expired state with re-auth prompt, network error in footer, refresh calls fetchNow() directly)
  - ClaudeUsage/Views/SettingsView.swift (updated - calls startPollingIfConfigured() after saving credentials)
  - prd.json (updated - US-009 passes: true)
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Use async Task.sleep(nanoseconds:) for polling intervals — cleaner than Timer.publish in a Combine-less context
  - performFetch must be @MainActor since it updates @Published properties
  - Re-read credentials from Keychain on each poll iteration in case they were updated by Set-Cookie or settings
  - ErrorState needs Equatable conformance for SwiftUI conditional checks (== operator)
  - Cancel the previous pollingTask before starting a new one in startPollingIfConfigured() to avoid multiple concurrent loops
  - ContentView refresh button should call fetchNow() directly instead of toggling a Bool flag — simpler and more reliable
