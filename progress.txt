## Codebase Patterns
- Use Xcode project (not SPM) since MenuBarExtra requires app bundle with Info.plist
- Build command: `xcodebuild -scheme ClaudeUsage -destination 'platform=macOS' build`
- Test command: `xcodebuild test -scheme ClaudeUsage -destination 'platform=macOS'`
- Source files in ClaudeUsage/ directory, tests in ClaudeUsageTests/
- When adding new .swift files, they must be added to the pbxproj file with PBXFileReference, PBXBuildFile, and added to the Sources build phase
- Info.plist is at ClaudeUsage/Info.plist with LSUIElement=true for menu bar-only app

## 2026-02-08 20:06 - US-001
- What was implemented: Xcode project scaffold with SwiftUI MenuBarExtra app, Info.plist with LSUIElement=true, and XCTest target
- Files changed:
  - ClaudeUsage.xcodeproj/project.pbxproj (new - Xcode project definition)
  - ClaudeUsage.xcodeproj/xcshareddata/xcschemes/ClaudeUsage.xcscheme (new - shared scheme)
  - ClaudeUsage/ClaudeUsageApp.swift (new - SwiftUI @main app with MenuBarExtra)
  - ClaudeUsage/Views/ContentView.swift (new - placeholder popover content)
  - ClaudeUsage/Info.plist (new - app metadata with LSUIElement=true)
  - ClaudeUsageTests/ClaudeUsageTests.swift (new - basic test target)
  - CLAUDE.md (updated - corrected build commands and directory paths)
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - MenuBarExtra requires an app bundle, so SPM executable won't work — must use Xcode project
  - pbxproj uses unique IDs (AA000001 format used here) — new files need entries in PBXFileReference, PBXBuildFile, and the relevant PBXSourcesBuildPhase
  - The scheme file must reference the correct BlueprintIdentifier matching the PBXNativeTarget ID
  - macOS deployment target is set to 13.0 in both project and target build settings
  - Swift 6.2.1 is on this machine, but project uses SWIFT_VERSION = 5.0 for compatibility
